# ViLearnX-Task-6


LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Develop a Python program to manage library resources like books, magazines, and DVDs. The system should include features for adding new items, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for items by title, author, or category. Design a user-friendly interface for efficient interaction. Implement functionality for all core operations: item management, fine calculation, and search capabilities. Utilize Python for programming, and consider using an IDE such as PyCharm or VS Code, along with a Database Management System for storing and retrieving data. This project will enhance your skills in Python programming and data management.
